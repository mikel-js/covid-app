# COVID-19 Information and Statistics APP
This app shows an up-to-date statistics of COVID-19 cases, the data comes from John Hopkins University. Also, there are some information about the symptoms and preventive measure. You can click on the countries to see a detailed report of their COVID-19 cases, including deaths and recovery.

### History of the App
I was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, as I am actively searching for a web developer job, then an idea come to my mind about sharing reliable information about COVID-19, so people can be more aware of the disease. I learnned new technologies recently, React Hooks and Styled components, so making an app using hooks makes sense. Also, I am a registered nurse, so I wanted to reach as many people as possible, to lessen the burden of front-liners, like nurses.

#### Technologies used
I used HTML, CSS, React, Hooks, React-bootstrap. I got the data from CSSE @ John Hopkins University.

#### I hosted the APP with its own domain name @ http://www.breakingcovid19.com/. Feel free to visit and enjoy!
